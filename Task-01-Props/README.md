# Task 1 - Using Props

For this project I had to display a list of books using props in React.

### `Reading List`

I created a seperate data file to keep data seperate and imported into my App file. I've loaded 4 books with each book having 4 properties which are as follows: id, title, author, image and a shor description. 

From there it follows a very basic structure normal to a React app.
