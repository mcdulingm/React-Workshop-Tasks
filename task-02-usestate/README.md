# Task 2 - Introducing useStates & useEffects

For this project I created a simple shopping list concept using useState and useEffect.

### `Shopping List`

I created a very basic shopping list component with already predefined shopping items that can be removed or cleared all at the same time. I had the idea to add a button that allows you to increase the amount of days before your next shopping trip.

In these early days of learning how to become familiar with React, I find it extremely frustrating to have an idea of what I want to do and how I can do it to just find myself being limited by how statements, function, component etc. is structured. It truly is like a learning a new language to communicate.
